For me, I grew up mostly being told what to do and never had many opportunities to make my own decisions. I believe the reason was because I had all my parents attention as I was an only child. Not only that, but I actually didn’t have any experience with software material till I took ICS 111 in my sophomore year and learned Java. At that time the class was the deciding factor to what type of career I wanted to choose.

Before taking ICS at the time I had a lot of stress thinking and contemplating what my career should be. Should I continue languages? Should I change over to the arts, or would business be better since it’s simpler? I just couldn’t determine where my interest lied. It wasn’t till I got some advice to talk to my relatives about their jobs, so I talked to them and started connecting them together. I realized than engineering might be a good consideration, because my father is a mechanical engineer. I also have two cousins in electrical and one cousin in mechanical. This made engineering have a very strong vote.

But then I started thinking of the future, watching the news I see AI’s progressing faster or companies like Apple upgrading for a better future. This made software education to stand out to me. So, because I have a cousin who is in IT, I went to go talk to her. Thanks to her I tried out ICS and in the end I came down to my final decision to choose Computer Engineering. 

With this I can not only learn software but also engineering at the same time. As I continue to learn software engineering, I can gain a better understanding for the movements to economy’s growth in technology.
