The software engineering community is a very sharing environment. As comrades in profession we will help one another in our software issues because we all know and understand what it is like to get stuck in our problems. Since I started learning software and if I ever came across a difficult standstill when I'm at home I've relied on StackOverflow. Through StackOverflow I have search for other similar questions as I did to reach a possible solution that others have already found a solution to. But because StackOverflow is such a large network I have had to look and read through a vast amount of questions and answers till I found any that was most similar to my problems.

## Compare Good vs. Bad

In the first image I have provided is a case of a good smart way to ask a question

First, search StackOverflow for a question submitted by a developer that demonstrates the “smart way”. Such a question should follow the precepts established by Raymond. In addition, the answers provided by the community should demonstrate that asking a question the smart way leads to both efficient and effective help.

Next, you will search for a question submitted by a different developer that demonstrates the “not smart way”. In other words, this question violates the principles established by Raymond. In addition, the answers provided by the community should demonstrate that asking a question in a “not smart” way does not lead to both effective and efficient help

Write a technical essay that discusses why smart questions are important for smart software engineers, how the chosen questions fulfill (or not) the precepts for smart questions, how the responses reflect the smartness (or lack thereof), and the insights you gained as a result of this experience.
