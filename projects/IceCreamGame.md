summary: My team and I coded an Ice cream Game for our ICS111 final project.
---

When determining project ideas I think it's always ended up being decided that my team does my idea. So for me and my teams ICS 111 final project we created a game called the Ice Cream Game. To play the game a combination of four colored circles will be displayed in the customerâ€™s speech bubble. The goal is to press the key corresponding to the ice cream flavor from top to bottom (creating a replication of the combination on the right of the cone). Successfully completing the combination will earn you a point.  Messing up at any point while making the ice cream cone will reset the correct flavor combination. The keys and their corresponding flavors will be shown on the left.  After time has ended, your score and the top three score will be shown.
