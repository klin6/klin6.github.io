summary: My team and I coded an Ice cream Game for our ICS111 final project.
---

When determining project ideas I think it's always ended up being decided that my team does my idea. So for me and my teams ICS 111 final project we created a game called the Ice Cream Game. To play the game a combination of four colored circles will be displayed in the customerâ€™s speech bubble. The goal is to press the key corresponding to the ice cream flavor from top to bottom (creating a replication of the combination on the right of the cone). Successfully completing the combination will earn a point. Messing up at any point while making the ice cream cone will reset the correct flavor combination. The keys and their corresponding flavors will be shown on the left. After time has ended, the present score and the previous top three scores will be shown.

Personally I worked on the main class and added background audio and sounds to play at the points when a new random combination appeared. For the keyCheck I assisted one of my partners on reorganizing the true and false of making sure that the right key is pressed from the arrays in setOrder. As for the setOrder I coded it to random generate from the orderGen for the scoop and combo arrays to line up with the flavor image array with help from my partner.

Here is the code in Github: <a href="https://github.com/klin6/ICSproj/tree/master/Project3e/Project3e"><i class="large github icon "></i>Ice Cream Game</a>

This project was my very first big software project, it took a good full month to contribute in and was very entertaining to debug. Although it's one of the basic kind of game in game development, to personally finish it makes a big impact to my own accomplishments.
