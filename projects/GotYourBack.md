summary: Proposed and developed a personal system that warns a user if a stranger is behind them for my EE296 project. 
---

For my EE296 project me and my partner decided to proposed and developed a personal security system that warns a user and calls an emergency contact if a stranger is approaching from behind them. This was implemented using Arduino and MIT Appinventor technology, while collecting data from an IR motion sensor. My role was to construct an app on the MIT Appinventor to be able to speak warnings and call an emergency contact after receiving data by bluetooth connection.
