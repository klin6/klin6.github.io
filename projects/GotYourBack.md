summary: Proposed and developed a personal system that warns a user if a stranger is behind them for my EE296 project. 
---

I imagine many have had the experience of walking in the dark and with very little people around. So it's always best to have a sense of security on hand, so that is why for my EE296 project me and my partner decided to propose and develop a personal security system that warns a user if a stranger is approaching from behind them. The system also allows the option of calling an emergency contact.

The project was implemented using Arduino and MIT Appinventor technology, while collecting data from an IR motion sensor. My role was to construct an app on the MIT Appinventor to be able to speak warnings and call an emergency contact after receiving data by bluetooth connection.  First me and my partner had to work together to code the sensor data readings to send toward the MIT. Then I build the MIT Appinventor to receive the data from the used IR motion sensor to speak message “person approaching” and implement the phone call function to call a emergency contact. So that the data will be received by bluetooth from the circuit board and android.

I enjoyed this small project because I was able to implement software and hardware together, which really helps to give me more experience as a computer engineer.
