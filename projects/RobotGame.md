summary: Created a simple battle role playing game for my EE205 final project.
---

To show how much me and my team learned C++, we decided to program a game where the user may choose between four different types of fighters, each from their own class to fight a robot boss.

We all worked on the project together. I put all code together, debugging, included mini-game, and displays. Grace and Sharmaine worked on main battle file.
